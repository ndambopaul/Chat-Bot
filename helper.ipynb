We're here to guide you on how to plan your finances and what to expect when you get to RGU.\\nFunding & Scholarships\\nRGU offers all direct entry, self-funding international students a discount on their fees to help with this initial stage. There are\\xa0various funding opportunities for international students through scholarships and companies we have\\xa0partnerships\\xa0with in the UK and in many international countries.\\nFind out more about Funding & Scholarships\\nTuition Fees\\nTuition fees are set in relation to the type of course you are studying.\\xa0For example, due to the materials required, laboratory based courses are often more expensive than class based ones. Fees for Overseas Students also differ from fees for UK and European Union students.\\nFees are listed on all course pages:\\nSearch for your course\\nPaying Tuition Fees\\nWe have an instalment plan to help spread the cost of paying your tuition fees. Detailed information about paying your tuition fees:\\nFull Time Self Funding Students\\nFlywire\\nRGU has partnered with Flywire\\xa0to accept payments from international students. Flywire enables international students to make payments securely in your own currency using local payment methods from the safety and convenience of your home.

However, we have created a rough guide to help with your planning.\\nThe things which are going to vary your cost of living will be:\\nThe type of\\xa0accommodation\\xa0you chose\\nTuition fees (see our\\xa0how to pay\\xa0section)\\nApplying for a Visa\\xa0(international student may require this)\\nIf you plan to take a\\xa0part-time job or not\\nHow much socialising and travelling you want to do whilst at Robert Gordon University\\nCost of Living\\nAs with relocating to any new place, once you are here you will learn where to find the best deals for buying food or clothes; what day it is cheapest to go the cinema etc. Aberdeen is a very student friendly city, so there are lots of special offers geared towards the student market, such as meal deals in restaurants and bars.\\nMany students find it helpful to have a contingency or emergency budget. This is in case they find it difficult to find a part time job or incur an unplanned expense such as contents insurance for your belongings or a television license for your property. According to research by UKCISA (UK Council for International Student Affairs) student finance is the number one concern for International Students, with many of the students who took part in their research saying that they underestimated the cost of living.\\nIt is important to be realistic about your expected costs for your time at Robert Gordon University, as we want you to have the best experience possible. Preparing a sensible budget will allow you to focus on your studies and enjoy your time in Aberdeen.\\nBringing Money to the UK\\nThere is no restriction on bringing money into the UK. However, you must declare to UK Customs if you bring more than the equivalent of €10,000 (approx. £8,000).\\nThis includes currency, travellers cheques and bankers drafts. If you are planning to bring some of your own currency, check first that you are permitted to take it out of your country, and secondly that it can be changed in the UK.\\nThere are many disadvantages with bringing large amounts of cash in to the UK. The most obvious problem is safety - if your cash is stolen, it is gone for good.\\nHowever you will need to bring some cash (£200 - £300) with you in order to meet day to day expenses, at least for the short term.\\nThe best and safest way to bring money is to either bring Sterling travellers cheques or arrange two bank drafts:\\none payable to The Robert Gordon University for your fees, with your student number and name on the back or as the reference details, and\\none for your living costs, payable to your own name\\nBringing bank drafts is one of the safest ways of bringing money to the UK. The down-side is that you will need to set up a bank account before you can receive the money. In addition to this, drafts can take up to two weeks to clear in your account (depending upon the bank). You should therefore bring some of your living costs as a mixture of cash and travellers cheques until your main draft clears.\\nWorking in the UK\\nAs an International Student it may be possible for you to work in the UK whilst you are studying, but your nationality will determine what conditions you need to meet so that you can work in the UK. The visa stamp on your passport will indicate if you are allowed to work or not.\\nAs an adult student with a suitable visa:\\nYou are allowed to work part-time during term time, up to a maximum of 20 hours a week and full-time during vacations\\nThe work you do must not fill a full-time permanent vacancy (other than on a recognised Foundation Programme), and you can not be self-employed\\nDue to Aberdeen being a good sized, thriving, social city, there are lots of opportunities for part time employment in restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, cinema and theatres. Some students also chose to take a part time position which relates to their career ambitions, so will take office or agency work such as web design or PR/marketing positions.\\nIn the UK, there is a\\xa0minimum wage system\\xa0which attempts to regulate payment for all employees. Find out the current National Minimum Wage from the\\xa0DirectGov website.\\nAt Robert Gordon University, we have an excellent Careers Centre that can help our students locate and prepare for applying to a range of local part time jobs whilst you are studying. Our\\xa0Careers Centre\\xa0can also help with career planning and how to prepare for the graduate employment market.\\nYou can find full information about working while studying from our\\xa0Student Services\\xa0department.\\nEmergency funds\\nShort Term Emergency Loans\\nYou can apply to the University for an Emergency Loan if you suddenly find yourself in financial difficulty.\\nFind out more about the Emergency Loan Fund\\nInternational Fund\\nThis fund is available to international students who have had a change in circumstances since starting their course which have resulted in them having financial difficulties.\\nFind out more about the International Fund\\nAcademic CalendarIT HelpdeskLibraryMoodleRGyoUEventsNewsRGView\\nUniversity PoliciesHealth & SafetyTransport & ParkingOpening HoursJobs at RGU\\nSitemapPrivacy & Cookie StatementFOIWhistleblowingComplaintsModern Slavery StatementAccessibility\\nRobert Gordon University, Garthdee House, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QB, Scotland, UK\\nA Scottish charity, registration No. SC013781\\nTop\\nCookie Consent\\nWe use cookies on this website to improve your browsing experience.

We look forward to welcoming you to the University.\\nWe hope to help provide you with some useful information to help you prepare for your departure, and your first few weeks as an RGU student here in the UK.\\nSupporting your Transition to RGU\\nWe have put together a PDF that highlights many key areas that international students should consider prior to travelling to Aberdeen, in addition to the guidance on this webpage.\\nPre-Arrival information to support your transition to RGU\\nPDF : 227.39 KB\\nDownload\\nBefore you leave home\\nVisa Information\\nOur Student Admissions Service are dedicated to supporting you throughout your visa application process.\\nWe have a specialist team in Immigration that can help you with your Student\\xa0Visa application.\\nRead more on the visa application process and important information to help guide you along this journey:\\nVisa Information\\nStudy Equipment and Technology\\nWhilst it is easy to pick up notebooks and pens to help with your studies when you arrive in Aberdeen, you may wish to bring with you a laptop or personal computer. This will allow you the independence to study wherever and whenever you want, and can be used for watching online lectures, learning online, completing assignments and also note taking during classes.\\nA laptop or personal computer is recommended to fully access all RGU’s systems and networks, as joining via a phone or tablet can offer a limited functionality.\\nSuggested minimum specification:\\nWindows laptop\\nOperating System: Windows\\u202f10.\\nMinimum Screen Size: 10 inches\\nMemory:\\u202f8 GB\\nHard Drive Size:\\u202f250 Gb, preferably more\\nWireless connectivity\\nAt least 1 USB Port\\nCamera, microphone and speaker\\nAnti-virus/anti-malware protection\\nApple Mac OS\\nOperating System:\\u202fApple iOS 11.x (2017)\\u202for later ^\\nMinimum Screen Size: 10 inches\\nMemory: 8 GB\\nHard Drive Size:\\u202f250 Gb, preferably more\\nWireless connectivity\\nAt least 1 USB port\\nCamera, microphone and speaker\\nAnti-virus/Anti-malware software\\nGet prepared – helpful research\\nWe recommend that you visit the British Council’s Study in the UK website, as this has lots of helpful advice to prepare ahead of your departure from your home country.\\nBritish Council - Starting your degree\\nBefore you start packing, please familiarise yourself with the UK Government’s rules on what you can bring into the country. There are several food stuffs you are not allowed to enter the country with, as well as there being a limit on the volume of alcohol and cigarettes you can carry with you.\\nUK Government - Travelling to the UK\\nDon’t worry about packing items you think you will not find here. Aberdeen is a multi-cultural welcoming city with many international supermarkets which cater for a variety of cuisines.\\nCost of Living\\nTravelling to join us in Aberdeen\\nTravel By Air\\nIf you are planning to travel to Aberdeen by air, many of the major airline carriers will allow international\\xa0 students a complimentary extra baggage allowance with proof of study, such as your Unconditional offer letter or student visa. This must be arranged in advance of travel so please speak to your airline at the point of booking your ticket.\\nAberdeen International Airport (ABZ) is a small, single terminal\\xa0airport, with several international connections from London, Amsterdam and Paris each day. If Aberdeen is your first point of landing in the UK, you will travel through UK Border Control here. If you transit via other UK airports, such as Heathrow, Manchester or Glasgow, you will pass through UK Border Control there.\\nOptions for onward travel from Aberdeen airport to your student accommodation include:\\nTaxi\\nThere is a regulated taxi rank outside the terminal of the airport, which has taxis 24 hours a day. It will cost approx. £30 to travel to Garthdee campus from the airport. Unregulated taxis are not allowed into the grounds of the airport.\\nAberdeen Airport - Taxis\\nBus\\nThere is a regular bus service, Jet 727, which runs 24 hours a day from outside the airport terminal and takes you to the bus station in the city centre. A ticket costs around £3.50.\\nStagecoach - Aberdeen Airport Buses\\nTravel By Rail/Bus/Coach\\nAberdeen has both a train station and a bus station located in the city centre, both with regular services to other UK cities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and London.\\nThere is a taxi rank located at the train station, which runs 24 hours a day. It will cost approximately £18 for a taxi to the Garthdee campus from the city centre. There is also a very regular local bus service which operates from a short distance away from the train and bus stations, on Union Street. This bus service connects the city of Aberdeen, with many different routes offered. If travelling to campus, please take First Bus, Route 1 or Route 2.\\nMoney Matters\\nTravelling and Arrival\\nWe advise all international students to travel with a small amount of cash with them, to cover your expenses for the first few days until your new bank account is set up. Ideally you want to bring this cash in £GBP, £250-£500 should be enough.\\nSetting up your bank account\\nAs it will take you a short while to set up your UK bank account, you may wish to consider a pre-paid credit card from your home country which will allow you to make withdrawals with ease in the UK. Some example companies which offer this are WeSwap and\\xa0Revolut.\\nInformation about how to set up your UK bank account is included in the Welcome Toolkit you will have access to on Moodle, once you have enrolled online.\\xa0Please note, some banks will require a bank support letter and proof of address to set up your bank account, which you can request from the Student Life Hub, or via AskRGU. Once you are enrolled you can self-serve a bank letter for some banks including TSB and HSBC via the MyRGU App. For other banks you can request from the Student Life Hub, or via AskRGU. Please note, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays do not need an RGU bank letter but will require other documents.\\nMore information about this is included in the ‘Finance and Banking Advice’ section of the Welcome Toolkit on Moodle:\\nMoodle - Welcome Toolkit\\nMoney Matters\\nPaying your tuition fees\\nRGU offers a flexible payment plan for your balance of tuition fees\\nHow to Pay - Full time Self Funding Student's Fees\\nCost of living and budgeting\\nAs the cost of living may be quite different from your home country, the key to financial success is researching your costs and budgeting. When you apply for your visa, the UKVI asks you to show that you have £9,270 to cover your living expenses (plus £6,120 per dependant) for each year of study. This will cover your core costs such as accommodation, food, and expenses like telephone bills, transport and clothing. We recommend you set a budget each month to ensure that all your core costs are covered from your financial requirement funds. You should not expect part time employment to cover your core costs.\\nIf you are bringing your family with you, it is essential that you research additional costs such as family sized accommodation and childcare as these may be considerably more expensive than in your home country.\\nLiving expenses are the responsibility of the student with very limited additional support available from the University or other sources, which is why budgeting is a key tool we recommend all students use.\\nFor more information about the cost of living and students with families\\nCost of Living\\nPart Time Working\\nFor all students, your first priority is to your education so before deciding if you wish to get a part time job, you should consider the time you have available once your study commitments are fulfilled. The result of your studies will last a lifetime, and therefore is far more valuable than earning a small amount of extra money in the short term. Your visa may allow you to work a maximum of 20 hours per week, but to achieve a balance of study, part time work, and enjoying your life in Aberdeen most students find 11 to 16 hours more suitable.\\nOur Careers and Employability team offers all students support and guidance on part time work and balancing your studies.\\nCareers Support - Supporting Individual Students\\nEnrolling and commencing your studies with RGU\\nYou will begin to receive communication from our Student Admissions Service regarding enrolment processes around early August. Please check your inbox for this notification.\\nDates for your diary\\nArrival on campus, enrolment and\\xa0course inductions begin 09 September 2024\\nStart of teaching - 16 September 2024\\nFinal date to enrol - 24 September 2024\\nFor new students on campus, Student Records will be in the Student Union, Riverside Building 09-20 September\\xa02024 between 10:00 - 13:00 to help with any enrolment questions you may have\\nFind out more about Enrolment\\nWelcome Toolkit\\nOur\\xa0guide for new International students provides essential information about visa and immigration support, as well as lots of useful advice to help you settle into life in Aberdeen and the UK.

If you have any queries about your application, we are happy to answer these over the phone or through email.\\nI have received a Conditional Offer, what do I do now?\\nMost international students will initially get a conditional offer of acceptance. This means we are happy in principle to accept you to study at Robert Gordon University but you must meet certain conditions first. The most common conditions are:\\nCompleting an existing course (for example passing your Bachelors before coming to do a Masters with us). Please upload your degree documents to your Apply Yourself record or email the Admissions Office with these.\\nProving that your English language is good enough for University-level study. In this case you should send us a copy of your IELTS or TOEFL certificate as soon as it is available. Please upload these documents to your Apply Yourself record or email the Admissions Office with these.\\nMaking a pre-payment (deposit) for international students. In this case you must arrange to pay the\\xa0 University before we can release an Unconditional Offer. To find out how to do this, please visit the\\xa0Making Payment\\xa0page.\\nHow do I get an Unconditional Offer and CAS letter?\\nOnce you have fulfilled the conditions of your Conditional Offer, we will issue your Unconditional Offer and CAS number and statement. The UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI)\\xa0requires CAS numbers and statements for all student visa applications.\\nThe personal CAS number we issue will link directly to the UKVI database to facilitate your visa application. Your CAS statement confirms that:\\nThe University is prepared to offer you a place on a course,\\nYou have met any academic conditions that were asked of you\\nYou have paid your pre-payment of your tuition fees as stated on your offer letter.\\nRegarding pre-payments, this means when we have received your payment in our bank account here in Aberdeen, which may be several weeks after you transfer it, if you are making an overseas bank transfer.\\nThe pre-payment policy of the university can be downloaded:\\nDeposit Policy for International Applicants\\nPDF : 72.44 KB\\nDownload\\nDeposits\\nAt Robert Gordon University, we have a policy for asking students to pay a deposit before an Unconditional Offer is made.\\nThis is in order to:\\nSupport the University's administrative and financial processes as well as the provision of immigration advice from UK Immigration authorities\\nMaintain a rigorous check to prevent fraudulent or frivolous applications\\nEnsure consistency of approach in line with our general duty to promote equality of opportunity in terms of the University's Equity and Diversity Policy.\\nThe pre-payment for students beginning their studies is\\xa0required - the exact amount you are required to pay will be stated on your offer letter. This must be paid before a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies) number and statement will be issued and sent to you, which are required for you to begin the visa application process.\\nIt is important to understand that the deposit is normally only refunded if a student fails to secure a visa to enter the UK as a student. For example if you pay the deposit and successfully arrive in the UK but then decide you want to study at a different institution, you will lose the deposit that you have paid.\\nWhen should I pay my deposit?\\nFor the correct dates for the intake you are applying to, please use our Application Deadline information which includes the deadline for paying your deposit.\\nApplication Deadlines\\nTo receive your Unconditional Offer in plenty of time so that you can apply for your UK student visa,\\xa0you should pay the deposit as early as possible.\\nIn some countries (Pakistan and Nigeria, for example) it can take many weeks at busy times (June - September) to obtain a UK student visa.

This tells us what your qualifications are equivalent to in the UK.\\nEnglish language requirement\\nAll International students have to be at a certain level of English ability before they can come and study in the UK. RGU has specific English qualifications which it accepts and these are listed on each course web pages. These qualifications meet UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) requirements.\\nIf an English qualification is not listed on the English Language Requirements pages, we cannot accept it.\\nAdmissions staff will check and verify what you have submitted.\\nThe level of English required differs depending upon the level of course studied so for example PhD study requires a higher level than Undergraduate study.\\nThe English evidence we accept will be included on your CAS as this is now a condition of your visa application.\\nPassport\\nThe majority of international students coming to RGU will need to have a valid passport to apply for a Student visa and enter the UK.\\xa0 There are exceptions, but you will need to check this with the UKVI. We recommend that your passport is valid for at least 6 months after your course start date, as it can take some time to obtain a new passport.\\xa0If at any time during the application process you obtain a new passport, you must notify us of this immediately\\xa0so that we can notify the UKVI or amend the CAS.\\nStatement of Purpose\\nYou may be asked to provide a Statement of Purpose as part of your application.\\xa0When this is needed, you will be told what we expect you to cover in the Statement.\\xa0 This will include details about why you have chosen to study in the UK, why you have chosen Robert Gordon University, what the course means for your career and how it will benefit this in future.\\nAcademic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\\nA small number of RGU’s courses require additional authorisation to study from the United Kingdom Home Office.To obtain this authorisation, you need to apply for an ATAS certificate.\\nThis certificate is valid for 6 months and is required as part of your visa application.\\nAs part of your conditional offer, the University will tell you if you require an ATAS certificate to study the course you have applied for.\\nIf you require an ATAS certificate, applications are made directly to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). The FCO provide detailed guidance on the ATAS certificate application process:\\nFCO -\\xa0 How to apply for an\\xa0ATAS\\xa0certificate\\nOther Conditions\\nThere can be other conditions, depending on your circumstances, where you come from, the course applied for and the application submitted.

Where these are required, details will be included in conditional offer letters when issued to you.\\nDeposit\\nAs part of your entry conditions, you may also need to pay a deposit, which is generally 34% of your course fee, but may be higher. Where this is required, details will be provided in your Conditional Offer letter\\nFurther Information\\nPlease do not send any documents until these are asked for as part of the application or by the Admissions Department or Immigration Team. When we ask for documents, unless we tell you otherwise, do not send original documents, send scans of them or very good quality photographs where all the details on the document can be seen.

This is extended to 3 years if the student has been awarded a Doctoral qualification.\\nThe new Graduate visa is designed to allow international students to study in the UK and then gain valuable work experience as they then go on to build successful careers.\\nGraduate Visa – Key Points\\nStudents are expected to have completed their previous study and been granted an award in the UK to be eligible for the Graduate visa.\\nThis award must have been achieved during the student’s most recent Tier 4/Student visa.\\xa0 Students cannot use a course which was completed historically prior to that being in place.\\nStudents must have a valid Tier 4 or Student visa and make their application to the Graduate visa, before this expires.\\nStudents must make their application for the Graduate visa in the UK.\\nIf a student leaves the UK before they receive a decision on the Graduate visa application, this is treated as withdrawn and they may no longer be eligible for the Graduate visa.\\nStudents must not have been previously granted a visa for the Graduate visa or Doctorate Extension Scheme (DES).\\nApplicants cannot switch to the Graduate visa from any type of immigration permission except Tier 4 or Student visas.\\nWhat you can and cannot do with a graduate visa\\nYou can study on short courses or work in any profession at any level, for any employer, EXCEPT as a professional sports person\\nYou cannot study a course which is accessible under the Student Visa route or access public funds.\\nWhat else might you need to know?\\nA new visa application will need to be made but the process is straightforward.\\xa0Our on-campus Student Immigration team are available for advice and assistance with your application.\\xa0 There is an application fee and a requirement to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge for the duration of the Graduate visa.\\nThere is no requirement to show the student holds a specific amount of money, as some were required to do for their Tier 4 or Student visa.\\nThere is also no English language requirement, as this is covered by the student’s successful completion of the award they were given the Tier 4 or Student visa for.\\nIt will be possible to switch from the Graduate visa to the Skilled Worker visa, at the end of the 2-year period, if the student finds a job which meets the requirements of that further route.\\nFurther information and costs involved:\\nUKVI\\xa0- Graduate Visa\\nAcademic CalendarIT HelpdeskLibraryMoodleRGyoUEventsNewsRGView\\nUniversity PoliciesHealth & SafetyTransport & ParkingOpening HoursJobs at RGU\\nSitemapPrivacy & Cookie StatementFOIWhistleblowingComplaintsModern Slavery StatementAccessibility\\nRobert Gordon University, Garthdee House, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QB, Scotland, UK\\nA Scottish charity, registration No. SC013781\\nCookie Consent\\nWe use cookies on this website to improve your browsing experience.

The living costs figure is set at £9,207 for Scotland.\\nTuition fees differ for different courses but to give you an example, if the course fee was £14,000, you had been awarded a scholarship of £2,000 and paid £5,000 deposit, the amount of money needed to show the UKVI would be £7,000 tuition fee and £9,207 living costs, total £16,207.\\nThe good news is that under the new Student visa, you do not have to show evidence of your finances for CAS or visa application if you are already in the UK on a valid visa and have been here under that visa for at least 12 months.\\xa0 If you think that this applies to you, please get in touch with us so that we can help you to confirm if it does.\\nImmigration Health Surcharge\\nA surcharge is paid as part of the Visa application and allows you to access to the National Health Service, which provides general healthcare in the United Kingdom.\\nThe cost for students is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The UKVI website publishes the current fees.\\nFind out how much you should have to pay:\\nUKVI - National Health Surcharge\\nYou can start using the National Health Service (NHS) when:\\nyou’ve paid the healthcare surcharge, and\\nyour visa or immigration application is granted\\nThe IHS payment covers all healthcare costs under the NHS once you’re in the UK.\\nWho can sponsor a student?\\nThere are a number of different ways that you can show you have the funds available for your studies.\\nSelf Financing & Education Loan\\nA self-financing student is someone who plans to pay their course fee and living costs from their own money and show their own personal bank statements or education loan as evidence when applying for a visa.\\nParent/Guardians\\nIf you wish to use a bank account in your parent's or guardian's name (or names), you must also include evidence of their relationship to you. This can be:\\nyour original birth certificate, showing the name of your parent(s) whose bank account you are using\\nan original certificate of adoption, showing your name and the name of your parent(s) whose bank account you are using\\nif you have a legal guardian, an original court document, which shows the name of your guardian(s) whose bank account you are using. This must have been issued when the student was still considered a child. An Affidavit is not accepted here.\\nIn addition to this you will also need to provide:\\nA letter of support from your parent/legal guardian indicating that they are happy to provide their funds to you.\\nCopies of their financial evidence which meets all UKVI requirements.\\nOther family members or friends\\nThis is perhaps the most common area of misunderstanding when it comes to sponsorship by others\\nIt is possible that anyone can pay money direct to your Student sponsor (in this case RGU) on your behalf, for example to pay your course fees or accommodation costs.\\nHowever, you cannot use evidence of money held in any other person's name, even with their permission, if they are not your parent or guardian. The best way to overcome this is for them to transfer the funds to your account. You’ll need to allow enough time for the funds to be held for the required period and get evidence of this, before you get your CAS and apply for your Student Visa.\\nYou can use a joint account with another person, provided you are named as one of the account holders.\\nYou can use an account from your spouse or partner alone but only where:\\nThey are applying for their visa at the same time as you, or,\\nThey already hold a visa for entry to the UK or are already in the UK on a visa.\\nOfficial financial sponsor\\nYou can also be sponsored by an official financial sponsor, which includes:\\nthe UK government\\nyour national government\\nthe British Council\\nany international organisation\\nan international company\\nany university\\nan Independent School\\nIf you receive funding from any of the named sources, you will need a letter from them confirming how much money they will contribute towards your course fees and living costs. The letter must show:\\nyour name\\nthe name and contact details of the official financial sponsor\\nthe length of the sponsorship\\nthe amount of money the sponsor is giving to you, or a statement that all course fees and living costs will be covered.\\nThe date of the letter must be no more than 6 months old when you use it to apply for your visa.\\nIf your official financial sponsor is not covering all of your course fees and maintenance, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the rest of the money required available to the UKVI.\\nCompany Sponsorship\\nThe UKVI have strict rules about being sponsored by a company and require that this is only done by an International Company. This generally means one which has a trading presence in more than one country.\\nThis means that the company must have an office in more than one country. They must be able to provide evidence of this such as providing their registration certificate or licence number in that country or a VAT/TAX letter displaying the address of the office in that country.\\nThe UKVI will verify this, both online and through access to internal resources, that this evidence is genuine.\\nIf the company who wishes to sponsor you meets this requirement then they should provide you with a letter which details the terms of that sponsorship.\\xa0 Where a company cannot meet these requirements, they can still give you funds but this must be done by transferring to you, where the category of Self-financing student then applies again.\\nFurther information\\nPlease do not send any documents until these are asked for by the Admissions Department or Immigration Team.\\xa0 When we ask for documents, unless we tell you otherwise, do not send original documents, send scans of them or very good quality photographs where all the details on the document can be seen.

The statement must be issued by a bank which the UKVI accept. This means the bank must be regulated by the official governing body which regulates the banking or financial industry in your country.\\nIn addition to showing information about the account holder, the account number, currency in which the funds are held and relevant dates, the bank statement must also be dated within 31 days of your Visa application.\\xa0 Purely as an example, if your bank statement was dated 1 January, we and the UKVI must be able to see that you have held the required amount of money for at least 28 days immediately before that date.\\xa0 You could then use this bank statement for a visa application up to 31 January but no later.\\nYou can provide a download of electronic bank statements as long as they show the required information. You no longer need to have these stamped by the bank.\\nThe UKVI will check your financial evidence as part of your visa application and if they cannot confirm this is accurate and authentic, your visa application will be refused on financial grounds.\\nYou can show more than one account in your own name if you have funds in several accounts, provided they meet the 28 day rule.\\nStatements can also be in different currencies.\\nYou can also use a letter from the bank saying the total amount of money available to you which has been held for 28 days immediately before the date of the letter.\\nYou can use a joint account if you are one of the people named on the account.\\nOther accounts\\nOther accounts or financial instruments such as shares, bonds, overdrafts, credit cards and line of credit are not acceptable, regardless of notice period.\\nCertificates of Deposit\\nThese are mostly acceptable but they must show a similar level of detail to that which is required for a bank statement.\\nWhen dealing with a Certificate of Deposit, we and the UKVI must be able to see that the funds are in the form of cash and are immediately available to the account holder for withdrawal.\\xa0 Very few certificates of deposit have this type information printed on them so you must also get a letter from the financial institution issuing the certificate confirming this and the amount which has been held for a minimum of 28 days counting back from the date of the letter.\\xa0 Using Certificates of Deposit can be tricky so if you are in any doubt whether what you have meets the UKVI requirements, get in touch and we will advise you.\\nDocuments\\nGovernment Sponsorship Letter sample\\nPDF : 154.16 KB\\nDownload\\nUsing a bank statement from your parents\\nPDF : 747.16 KB\\nDownload\\nCompany Sponsorship Letter sample\\nPDF : 130.66 KB\\nDownload\\nBank Support Letter\\nPDF : 243.18 KB\\nDownload\\nFurther Information\\nPlease do not send any documents until these are asked for by the Admissions Department or Immigration Team.\\xa0 When we ask for documents, unless we tell you otherwise, do not send original documents, send scans of them or very good quality photographs where all the details on the document can be seen.\\xa0 Keep original documents for your visa application.\\nIf you have any questions about your financial evidence and cannot find the answers on our web pages, please contact Immigration@rgu.ac.uk\\nAcademic CalendarIT HelpdeskLibraryMoodleRGyoUEventsNewsRGView\\nUniversity PoliciesHealth & SafetyTransport & ParkingOpening HoursJobs at RGU\\nSitemapPrivacy & Cookie StatementFOIWhistleblowingComplaintsModern Slavery StatementAccessibility\\nRobert Gordon University, Garthdee House, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QB, Scotland, UK\\nA Scottish charity, registration No. SC013781\\nTop\\nCookie Consent\\nWe use cookies on this website to improve your browsing experience.

Please keep the certificate for your visa application and UK Border entry.\\nA complete list of Home Office approved TB testing clinics is published and updated by the UKVI:\\nUKVI - TB Testing clinics\\nDifferentiation Arrangements and Document Requirements\\nThere are different documentary requirements under the Student Route for nationalities of certain countries, referred to by the UKVI as ‘Low Risk’ countries.\\xa0 ‘Low Risk’ country nationals do not routinely have to present educational or financial documents as part of their application for a Visa. This is known as “Differentiation Arrangements”. Although you may not need to present this evidence, it is important however that you are able to produce these documents to the UKVI if asked for, as this is a requirement of the visa application.\\nCountries benefiting from this arrangement are listed in paragraph ST 22.1\\xa0in:\\nImmigration Rules: Appendix Student\\nWhere you are entitled to Differentiation Arrangements, RGU will similarly not require to see your financial evidence unless we specifically ask you to show us this prior to issuing the CAS.\\nFurther Information\\nTB Certificate for Visa Application\\nPDF : 1.32 MB\\nDownload\\nPlease do not send any documents until these are asked for by the Admissions Department or Immigration Team.\\xa0 When we ask for documents, unless we tell you otherwise, do not send original documents, send scans of them or very good quality photographs where all the details on the document can be seen.

This is a unique 14 digit reference number.\\nRGU will issue your CAS up to 5 months before the start date of your course.\\nOnce we have your CAS number, we will send you an email with your CAS information. This contains details of what we have used to assess your application.\\xa0 The evidence we have used to assess your English language ability is always listed. The other details will differ in almost every case. This depends on you the individual applicant, where you are coming from, which course you are studying and how much money you have paid towards your course.\\nIt is vitally important that the details of the CAS letter are checked thoroughly and any errors or amendments required are notified to the University as soon as possible. Even if the CAS letter is correct, any subsequent changes, such as a change of passport, any additional fees paid towards accommodation or tuition must be notified to the University as soon as possible. This is so we can update the UKVI and make sure they have the most up to date information when you apply for your visa. After you have used the CAS for the visa application, the CAS can no longer be amended, meaning any significant changes may require a new CAS.\\nThe CAS may also show how much you have paid towards RGU accommodation. The UKVI rule is this can only be shown if the money has been paid directly to the University, for RGU-owned accommodation. A maximum of £1,334 can be shown, even if you have paid more.\\nIf you can show that you have already paid all or some of your accommodation fees to RGU before making your Visa application, this amount, up to a maximum of £1,334, will also be taken away from the total amount of money you will need to show to the UKVI for your visa application.\\nWe cannot include payments made to third-party accommodation providers as the UKVI do not allow this. Examples of third-party accommodation providers include Unite and U-Student.\\nOnce we have issued your CAS, we will also send out your full Unconditional Offer.\\nYou can then apply for your Student visa.\\nThe University take no part in the visa application process after this and cannot answer questions about the individual application.\\xa0 You should direct any questions that you might have to UKVI directly.\\nYour CAS explained\\nPDF : 780.34 KB\\nDownload\\nApplying for your Student Visa\\nWe recommend that you apply for your visa as soon as possible after receiving your CAS.\\nThe reason for this is that the sooner you submit your application, the quicker you will be able to get your visa.\\xa0 There are a number of benefits to this.\\nPlease remember that your financial evidence must be no more than 31 days old on the date that you make your Student Visa application.\\nWhere this is still in date, for your visa application, you should use the\\xa0same\\xa0financial evidence you submitted for your CAS.\\xa0 This is because we believe it meets UKVI requirements.\\xa0 If you submit evidence we have not seen, we cannot be sure that evidence will be suitable and that increases the risk of a visa refusal.\\nYou should aim to apply for your Student Visa no later than two weeks after you have been sent your CAS Number (unless we have specifically advised that you should make your application sooner).\\nDo not delay applying for your Student Visa.\\xa0In our experience, late arrivals to our courses are often caused by late visa applications and UKVI delays in processing. You can avoid this by submitting your application promptly after receiving your CAS.\\nBy delaying submitting your Student Visa application, your application is more likely to be processed during a peak period for the UKVI.\\xa0 In these peak periods, your application will take longer to be processed, beyond advertised timescales in most cases, even when you have applied using Priority or Super Priority services.\\nWaiting for a decision on your Student Visa application can be stressful, particularly if your course start date is approaching. You can minimise this stress by making your application as soon as possible. Receiving your visa earlier will give you more time to plan your travel to Aberdeen and arrange accommodation.\\xa0 Having the visa early, will give you more options for accommodation in the city and also better options to organise things like schooling or child care, if you are bringing children with you.\\xa0 All of these things can take a considerable time to organise in the UK and being able to organise this earlier will alleviate your stress. You will also find that your international flights are cheaper when booked well in advance and availability of these diminishes significantly where the time you have left to be here reduces.\\xa0 You will have the best student and academic experience and chances of a successful course if you are enrolled and ready to attend classes when your course starts, rather than having materials to catch up on.\\nPlease be aware that if your Student Visa is not granted in time for you to enrol at RGU (enrolment periods are advertised online, and are also stated in your CAS Statement), you will be unable to join your course.\\xa0 Even if your Student Visa is then granted after the course start date, extensions to the enrolment period are not possible.\\xa0 Every intake there are students who delay applying for their visa and do not get this in time to enrol.\\xa0 These students have their visas withdrawn and can lose a lot of money in the process, something the university cannot be held responsible for.\\nVisa application costs\\nStudent visa application\\xa0fee\\nThe UKVI publishes student visa application fees. This information is updated when there are any changes to fees. If you have Dependants who are making application(s) alongside you, remember you’ll need to pay the application fee for each person.\\nAdditional student visa application services\\nYou may wish, or be required to, make your Student visa application using additional services such as Priority or Super Priority processing. Some Visa Application Centres will also offer other services such as application checking or assisted scanning. These costs are paid in addition to the Student visa application fee. The services provided by each Visa Application Centre do vary; please check full details of the services available at your chosen Visa Application Centre individually.\\nImmigration Health Surcharge (IHS)\\nA surcharge is paid as part of the Visa application and allows you to access to the National Health Service, which provides general healthcare in the United Kingdom.\\nThe cost for students is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The UKVI website publishes the current fees.\\nFind out how much you should have to pay:\\nUKVI - NATIONAL HEALTH SURCHARGE\\nYou can start using the National Health Service (NHS) when:\\nyou’ve paid the healthcare surcharge, and\\nyour visa or immigration application is granted\\nThe IHS payment covers all healthcare costs under the NHS once you’re in the UK.\\nCredibility interview\\nAs part of your Student Visa application, the UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) service may carry out a short interview with you. If you are selected for this, the UKVI will tell you when the interview will take place.\\nThis is called a Credibility Interview.\\xa0 It is designed by the UKVI to confirm that students entering the UK are genuine and help to prevent visa abuse. There is no set time limit for the interview, but it usually lasts 10 - 30 minutes. The interview is carried out in English, which gives the UKVI another opportunity to ensure that your English language ability meets the standard for a visa.\\nYou have already told the University why you want to come to the UK to study and why you have chosen the course. The UKVI will ask you for further detail about this.\\xa0 More information:\\nRGU guide to UKVI Credibility Interviews\\nPDF : 345.39 KB\\nDownload\\nVisa/biometric residence permit (BRP)\\nOnce your Visa has been granted, there are two different ways that you may receive this.\\nThe first is the UKVI placing an entry in your passport, known as a Vignette, which authorises entry clearance to the UK. Your vignette will show a start date and an expiry date. You can only enter the UK between these dates. The vignette grants you initial entry to the UK only, it does not allow you to remain here after the period specified on the vignette.\\nIn order to remain here after the period of your vignette, you must collect your Biometric Residence Permit. This is a card, similar in size to a credit card, which contains your personal and biometric information. You should collect it within 10 days of arrival in the UK, at the Post Office which you identified for collection in your visa application.\\nThe second is where nationals of some countries (usually EU countries) are not issued with a vignette or BRP, and instead, are given electronic immigration status. You’ll be able to prove your immigration status by using the UKVI’s online service:\\nUKVI - View and Prove Your Immigration Status\\nVisa refusals\\nUnfortunately, not all applications are successful. If your visa application is refused, you will be issued with a Visa Refusal Notice by the UKVI. The document will explain the reason or reasons for refusal. You must send a copy this to us as soon as you receive it.\\nIt may be appropriate for you to apply for Administrative Review. This is a UKVI review of the circumstances, to ensure the decision is appropriate based on the process carried out. The review is carried out by a completely separate department from that which issued the initial refusal. The result, which should be issued within 28 days, is either that the decision is upheld (the refusal remains) or it is overturned, at which time a Visa can be issued.\\nFurther Information\\nUK Visas and Immigration have a useful Visa Fees Tool which you can use to check how much your Student Visa application will cost.\\nUKVI - How to apply for your UK Student Visa guide\\nPDF : 214.75 KB\\nDownload\\nIf you have any questions about your application please email\\xa0admissions@rgu.ac.uk\\xa0and we will be happy to help.\\nAcademic CalendarIT HelpdeskLibraryMoodleRGyoUEventsNewsRGView\\nUniversity PoliciesHealth & SafetyTransport & ParkingOpening HoursJobs at RGU\\nSitemapPrivacy & Cookie StatementFOIWhistleblowingComplaintsModern Slavery StatementAccessibility\\nRobert Gordon University, Garthdee House, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QB, Scotland, UK\\nA Scottish charity, registration No. SC013781\\nTop\\nCookie Consent\\nWe use cookies on this website to improve your browsing experience.

Providing your Share Code to RGU will allow us to confirm your status and right to study in the UK.\\nPlease note that the deadline for applications for the EU Settlement Scheme was 30 June 2021. Some applications may still be considered. You can find out more about late applications on theUK Government website.\\nStudent Visa\\nIf you have not obtained pre-settled or settled status and will be studying on campus at RGU for more than six months, you will require a Student Visa. You should follow the Student Visa advice provided in the rest of this section of the RGU website.\\nIt is very important that you wait to receive the decision of your Student Visa application before travelling to the UK. Without confirmation of your Student Visa having been granted, you will not have the correct permission to study in the UK and may encounter difficulties with Border Force when entering the UK.\\xa0 This ultimately may mean that you have to leave the UK and re-enter under the terms of your Student Visa, before you can start your course.\\nStudying for Six Months or Less\\nIf you will be studying at RGU as part of an exchange or Study Abroad agreement, lasting six months or less, you will not require a Student Visa. You can undertake this as a visitor to the UK. You can use the Check if your need a UK visa tool if you are unsure. Alternatively, you can get in touch with the RGU staff arranging your exchange/Study Abroad placement.\\nFurther Information\\nIf you have any questions about your application please email\\xa0admissions@rgu.ac.uk\\xa0and we will be happy to help.\\nAcademic CalendarIT HelpdeskLibraryMoodleRGyoUEventsNewsRGView\\nUniversity PoliciesHealth & SafetyTransport & ParkingOpening HoursJobs at RGU\\nSitemapPrivacy & Cookie StatementFOIWhistleblowingComplaintsModern Slavery StatementAccessibility\\nRobert Gordon University, Garthdee House, Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QB, Scotland, UK\\nA Scottish charity, registration No. SC013781\\nTop\\nCookie Consent\\nWe use cookies on this website to improve your browsing experience.

    "## Data Processing Component\n",
    " To effectively integrate the data gathered from the RGU website into our chatbot, we must ensure the data is structured and manageable within the limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT. Initially, we will employ web scraping techniques to collect all relevant data from the university's blog posts and other pertinent sections. However, given the context length limitations of LLMs, we need to carefully manage the length of the documents we process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have collected all the data, we face the challenge of these LLM context limits. Large documents can exceed the input capacity of these models, leading to inefficient processing and potentially truncated or incomplete responses. To address this, we will utilize the CharacterTextSplitter from LangChain, a tool specifically designed to handle such scenarios by splitting text into smaller, more manageable chunks without losing context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "1. Access and Collect Data:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Utilize web scraping techniques to gather comprehensive data from the RGU website. This includes course information, faculty profiles, and other relevant sections that provide valuable insights for international students.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter and Extract Relevant Text:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Implement a method, such as extract_text_from(url), to filter and extract text specifically from sections pertinent to our chatbot’s objectives. This method ensures we only process content that directly contributes to answering common queries from international students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Manage Document Length:\n",
    "\n",
    ">To comply with LLM context limitations, employ the CharacterTextSplitter from LangChain. This tool will segment the collected text into smaller parts, making it feasible for the LLM to process the data effectively."
